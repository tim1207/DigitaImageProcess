We have a CSV file, which contains 9x9 metrics of 0 and 1. 
You should code a Matlab .m file to solute the 4-adjacency and 8-adjacency problems.
The Matlab .m file name and the function name should be "ComputeAdjacency". 
The function has two inputs first is "x" to represent what kind of adjacency 
it can be 4 or 8 and the second input is "csvFilePath" which means the CSV file you want to read, 
the output value of the function is your result.

Ex: function result = ComputeAdjacency(x, csvFilePath)

I will type this command to check your answer
>> ComputeAdjacency(4, "9x9Sample.csv")
	result = ...

You can read CSV files this way:
inputArray = csvread('9x9sample.csv') 

If you want to code with another way, please give the description file to let me can execute your program.
If I can't execute your program correctly, you can't get any score for this homework.

The assignment is due October 20th, 2021 11:59PM. Please only upload your .m file and compress to zip file with "Name_HW1" as your file name.
